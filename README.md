# M1-Computer-Vision
The code was entirely written in matlab but also some ideas have been explored in openCV python library.

This project work includes:
1. Harrison corner detection: Applying gaussian filter and then identifying corners by computing "R" matrix.
2. Camera calibration toolbox (http://www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib_doc/) has been explored. Corner extraction and main calibration were performed for left and right camera images.
3. Epipolar Geometry: calculation of fundamental matrix and epipoles of both cameras to generate the epipolar line.
4. 3D Reconstruction of an image with different shapes like pyramid, cube, rectangle.
